# Classification of thyriod cancer patients in the UK Biobank database using supervised machine learning methods

***Abstract:*** *Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide and has reached epidemic levels in recent years. Thyroid cancer is notoriosly difficult to diagnose as it typically becomes detectable as thyroid nodules with only 5-15% of nodules being cancerous. The ubiquity of benign thyroid nodules means that further diagnostic techniques like high-resolution unltrasonography and fine needle aspiration biopsies must be used to diagnose the disease. These techniques have limitations in that they are labour intensive, invasive, dependent on the skill of the clinician, and have accuracies ranging from 70-97%. The widely decribed prolblems of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment have frequently been attributed to the limitations of current diagnistic techniques and it is clear that there is a need for improved thyroid cancer diagnostic techniques.*

*The use of machine learning techniques in biomedical research is on the rise and diagnosis by machine learning models is becoming available for an increasing number of conditions. This work looked to utilise three machine learning models using phenotype data from UK Biobank to address the limitations of current diagnostic techniques and classfy individuals with thyroid cancer. The random forest, support vecotr machine, and multilayer perceptron models evaluated were all found to perform poorley on the dataset. These results suggest that for thyroid cancer diagnosis, the phenotype features in the UK Biobank do not contain enough information about the thyroid for the predictive models to succeed.*

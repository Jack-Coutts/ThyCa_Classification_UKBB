# Classification of thyriod cancer patients in the UK Biobank database using supervised machine learning methods

***Abstract:*** *Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide and has reached epidemic levels in recent years. Thyroid cancer is notoriosly difficult to diagnose as it typically becomes detectable as thyroid nodules with only 5-15% of nodules being cancerous. The ubiquity of benign thyroid nodules means that further diagnostic techniques like high-resolution unltrasonography and fine needle aspiration biopsies must be used to diagnose the disease. These techniques have limitations in that they are labour intensive, invasive, dependent on the skill of the clinician, and have accuracies ranging from 70-97%. The widely decribed prolblems of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment have frequently been attributed to the limitations of current diagnistic techniques and it is clear that there is a need for improved thyroid cancer diagnostic techniques.
